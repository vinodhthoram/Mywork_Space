# AUTOSCALING

## What is Auto scaling?
*  aws AutoScaling allows us to scale our amazon ec2 capacity out or dowmn
   automatically according to the load patterns.

* we can expand the number of amazon Ec2 instances from 1 to 100+ automatically during load peaks.
* we can reduce the number of amazon Ec2 instances from 100 to 1 automatically during load valleys. 

* create a group of Ec2 instances that can scale up or down depending on 
  conditions you set.
* enable Elasticity by scaling horizontally by adding or terminating Ec2 instances.
* enable fault tolerance through health checks of Ec2 instances
